Initial concentrations file format, version 1.0

The file is divided in two sections, header and data.
$ConcentrationFormat
1.0 file-type data-size
$EndConcentrationFormat
$Concentrations
  number-of-concentrations
  concentration-number element-number value
$EndConcentrations

Where

file-type int - is equal 0 for the ASCII file format.

data-size int - the size of the floating point numbers used in the file. Usually data-size = sizeof(double)

number-of-concentrations int - Number of concentrations defined in the file.

concentration-number int - is the number (index) of the n-th concentration. These numbers do not have to be given in a consecutive (or even an ordered) way. Each number has to be given only once, multiple definition are treated as inconsistency of the file and cause stopping the calculation.

element-number int - id number of the element where concentration is prescribed.

value double - value <0;1> of the concentration in initial time step.

Comments concerning 1-2-3-FLOW:
	Number of concentraions has to be same as number of elements. Program stops computation in the other case.
