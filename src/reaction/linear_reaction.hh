/** @brief class Linear_reaction is used to enable simulation of simple chemical reactions
 *
 * Class in this file makes it possible to realize  simulation of reaction of the first order by simple matrix multiplication.
 * One step of the linear reaction is represented as a product of a matrix containing concentrations of observed speciesin elements in rows multiplied by so called
 * reaction_matrix. Through this way radioactive decay can bee also realized and that was exactly what we did at the begining of journey. :-)
 * Matrix containing concentrations has a dimension Nxn, where N is a number of elements in mesh and n denotes a number of transported chemical species.
 * The reaction_matrix is a square matrix and it has a dimension nxn.
 *
