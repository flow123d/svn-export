Test problem 7 - THE MOST EASY UNSTEADY TEST
---------------------
verification of:
-unsteady flow
     Domain is cuboid.
     Material parameters are homogenous.
     Scenario of task is:
     * step 0 - steady task
       time t = ( -inf, 0 >
       boundary conditions (BC) are on the two smallest sides,
       head of water level is linear
     * step 1 - unsteady task
       time t = ( 0, inf )
       no boundary conditions (on all sides is used Neumann BC q=0),
       the head of water level is horizontal (average value of BC from step 0)
