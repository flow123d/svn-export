\section{Overview}
Flow123D is a software for simulation of water flow and reactionary solute transport in a heterogeneous 
porous and fractured medium. In particular it is suited for simulation of underground processes in a granite rock massive.
The program is able to describe explicitly processes in 3D medium, 2D fractures, and 1D chanels and exchange between 
domains of different dimension. The computational mesh is therefore collection of 3D tetrahedrons, 2D triangles and 1D line segments.

The water flow model assumes a saturated medium described by Darcy law. For discretization, we use lumped mixed-hybrid finite element method.
We support both steady and unsteady water flow.

The solute transport model can deal with several dissolved substances. It contains non-equilibrium dual porosity model, 
i.e. exchange between mobile and immobile 
pores. There is also model for several types of adsorption in both the mobile and immobile zone. The implemented adsorption models are
linear adsorption, Freundlich isotherm and Langmuir isotherm. The solute transport model uses finite volume discretization 
with up-winding in space and explicit Euler discretization in time. The dual porosity and the adsorption are introduced into transport by operator splitting.
The dual porosity model use analytic solution and the non-linear adsorption is solved numerically by the Newton method.

Reaction between transported substances can be modeled either by a SEMCHEM module, which is slow, but can describe all sorts of reactions. On the other hand,
for reactions of the first order, i.e. linear reactions or decays, we provide our own solver which is much faster. Reactions are coupled with transport 
by the operator splitting method,

The program provides output of the pressure, the velocity and the concentration fields in two file formats. You can use file format of GMSH mesh generator and post-processor 
or you can use output into widely supported VTK format. In particular we recommend Paraview software for visualization and post-processing of VTK data.

The program is implemented in C/C++ using essentially PETSC library for linear algebra. The water flow as well as the transport simulation and reactions can be computed 
in parallel using MPI environment. 

The program is distributed under GNU GPL v. 3 license and is available on the project web page:
http://dev.nti.tul.cz/trac/flow123d

\section{Basic usage}

\subsection{How to run the simulation.}
On the Linux system the program can be started either directly or through a script \verb'flow123d.sh'. When started directly, e.g. by the command
\begin{verbatim}
  > flow123d -s example.ini
\end{verbatim}
the program requires one argument after switch \verb'-s' which is the name of the principal input file. Full list of possible command line arguments is as follows.

\begin{description}
 \item[-s {\bf\it file}] \hfill\\
 	 Set principal INI input file. All relative paths in the INI file are relative against current directory.
 \item[-S {\bf\it file}] \hfill\\
 	Set principal INI input file. All relative paths in the INI file are relative against directory of the INI file. This is equivalent
to change directory to the directory of the INI file at the start of the program.
 \item[-i {\bf\it path}] \hfill\\
 	When there is string \verb"${INPUT}" %$
  	in the any path in the INI file, it will be replaced by given {\it path}.
 \item[-o {\bf\it path}] \hfill\\
 	Every relative path for any output file will be relative to this {\it path}. 
\end{description}

All other parameters will be passed to the PETSC library. An advanced user can influence lot of parameters of linear solver. In order to get list of supported options 
use parameter \verb'-help'.


You can use script \verb'flow123d.sh' to start parallel jobs or limit resources used by the program. This script accepts the same parameters as the program itself
and further some additional parameters.

\begin{description}
  \item[-h] \hfill\\
  	Usage overview.
  \item[-t {\bf\it timeout}] \hfill\\
  	Upper estimate for real runing time of the calculation. Kill calculation after {\it timeout} seconds. 
  	Can also be used by PBS to choose appropriate job queue. 
  \item[-np {\bf\it number of processes}] \hfill\\
  	Specify number of parallel processes for calculation.
  \item[-m {\bf\it memory limit}] \hfill\\
  	Limits total available memory to {\it memory limit} bytes.
  \item[-n {\bf\it priority}] \hfill\\
  	Change (lower) priority for the calculation. See {\tt nice} command.
  \item[-r {\bf\it out file}] \hfill\\
  	Stdout and stderr will be redirected to {\it out file}.
\end{description}

On the Windows system you have to use Cygwin libraries in other to emulate Linux API. The program with libraries can be downloaded form:

\verb'http://dev.nti.tul.cz/~brezina/flow123d_packages/'

Then you can start a sequential run by command:
\begin{verbatim}
  > flow123d.exe -s example.ini
\end{verbatim}
or a parallel run by command:
\begin{verbatim}
  > mpiexec.exe -np 2 flow123d.exe -s example.ini
\end{verbatim}
The program accepts the same parameters as the Linux version, but there is no script similar to \verb'flow123d.sh' on Windows system.


\subsection{Structure of input}

The principal input file of the program is an INI file which contains names of other necessary input files.
Those are the file with calculation mesh (\verb'*.msh'), the file with specification of adjacency between dimensions (\verb'*.ngh'),
the file with material description (\verb'*.mtr') and the file with boundary conditions for the water flow problem (\verb'*.bcd').
For unsteady water flow you have to specify file with initial condition for the pressure (key \verb'Input/Initial') and optionally one can introduce 
file with water sources (key \verb'Input/Sources').

In the case of transport simulation one have to specify also the file with transport boundary conditions (\verb'*.tbc') 
and the file with transport initial condition
for individual substances (\verb'*.tic').

      \caption{Preparation of input files.}
      \label{obr3}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}


For the preparation of input files we use several utilities (see Figure \ref{obr3}). 
We usually begin with a \verb'*.geo' file as a description of the domain geometry. This come as an input for the GMSH mesh generator, which produce 
the mesh file. Then we run program \verb'ngh' to produce adjacency file. Finally we can use program \verb'bcd' for the preparation of files with
boundary and initial conditions. The file with material properties has to be created manually, preferably by modifying some of the example problems.
The programs \verb'ngh' and \verb'bcd' are distributed together with flow123d with their own limited documentation.

The output files can be either \verb'*.pos' files accepted by the GMSH or one can use VTK format that can be post-processed by Paraview.

In following sections we briefly describe structure of individual input files.
