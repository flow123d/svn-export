Transport boundary conditions file format, version 1.0

The file is divided in two sections, header and data.
$Transport_BCDFormat
1.0 file-type data-size
$EndTransport_BCDFormat
$Transport_BCD
  number-of-conditions
  transport-condition-number boundary-condition-number value
$EndTransport_BCD

Where

file-type int - is equal 0 for the ASCII file format.

data-size int - the size of the floating point numbers used in the file. Usually data-size = sizeof(double)

number-of-conditions int - Number of conditions defined in the file.

transport-condition-number int - is the number (index) of the n-th transport condition. These numbers do not have to be given in a consecutive (or even an ordered) way. Each number has to be given only once, multiple definition are treated as inconsistency of the file and cause stopping the calculation.

boundary-condition-number int - id number of the boundary-condition where transport boundary condition is prescribed.

value double - value <0;1> of the concentration.

Comments concerning 1-2-3-FLOW:
	Number of transport boundary conditions has to be same as number of boundary conditions. Program stops computation in the other case.
