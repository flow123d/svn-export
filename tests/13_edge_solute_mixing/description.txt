Test problem 13
---------------------
verification of:
-edge mixing
-transport (convection)
-flow/transport interconnection


Analytic solution for:

Explanatory note: 
first branch (negative Z coordinate)
second branch (positive Z coordinate)
main branch (branch in the XY plane)

Flow:
-total flow  = 0.875 M/L^3
- first branch flow  = 0.795 M/L^3 
- second branch flow  = 0.080 M/L^3

Preasure:
- loss of preasure in the main branch  = 4.375 L
- loss of preasure in the other branches  = 5.625 L

Time:
solute in intersection: 5.71 T
solute at the end of the first branch: 14.60 T
solute at the end of the second branch:  94.60 T
