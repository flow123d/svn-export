Test problem 14
---------------------
verification of:
- time variable bc for transport

setting:
- 2D strip, horizontal
- constant velocity field = 1
- apply dirichlet BC on inflow (on right)
  pulses:
  time: 0       conc: 0
  time: 1       conc: 20 (time interval 1-3)
  time: 3       conc: 0
  time: 6       conc: 40 (time interval 6-7)
  time: 7       conc: 0
