This directory is meant for unit tests based on CppUnit or similar tools.

In order to test also correct ASSERTs there should be possibility catch the error messages e.g.
there could be compiler flag that makes xprintf throw exception containing the text of the message.
Then in the test we just check that exception was thrown. We can not check that the right exception
was thrown unless we compare the text of the message, but that could be dangerous
since texts are often changed.
