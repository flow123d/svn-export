  <h1>The deal.II license</h1>

  <p>
  The <acronym>deal.II</acronym> library has been placed under an Open
  Source license, in the sense advocated by the <a
  href="http://www.opensource.org" target="_top">Open Source
  Initiative</a>. You are thus free to copy and use it, and you have
  free access to all source codes. However, <acronym>deal.II</acronym>
  is not in the public domain, it is property of and copyrighted by
  the <acronym>deal.II</acronym> authors, and there are restrictions
  on its use. We will give some hints on license issues first. The
  legally binding license is the <a href="#license-text">Q Public
  License (QPL)</a> at the bottom of this page. Furthermore, deal.II
  distributions come bundled with some third party software for which
  the deal.II authors do not own the copyright. The licenses of these
  parts are discussed <a href="#3rdparty">below</a>.

  <p>
  In this document, as well as in the program files, the terms
  <i>authors of <acronym>deal.II</acronym></i> and
  <i><acronym>deal.II</acronym> authors</i> generally refer to the
  principal authors of the library. These are Wolfgang
  Bangerth, Guido Kanschat and Ralf Hartmann.
  </p>



  <h3>Restrictions on and commercial use of the library</h3>

  <p>

  <acronym>deal.II</acronym> is distributed under the <a
  href="http://www.opensource.org/osd.html" target="_top">Open Source
  license</a> called the <em>Q Public License</em> (or "QPL") listed
  in full below. Essentially, an interpretation of this license is
  that you can use the library free of charge for developing your own
  programs. However, if you plan to distribute these programs to others, 
  certain restrictions are imposed by the QPL.
  
  <p>

  In non-legal terms, the license stipulates that if you want
  to give your program to someone else in whatever form (including as
  a binary executable), you have to make the entire source code of
  your own program and all modifications to the deal.II library
  available free of charge as well.

  <p>

  We recognize that giving away the source code may be an
  unacceptable restriction in a commercial setting. As the owners of
  the sources, we are able to grant you a differently licensed version
  of the deal.II library that does not contain this
  requirement, and we are very much willing to negotiate the terms of
  such a license. Please contact the authors of the library if you are
  interested in commercial use of deal.II.



  <h3>Referencing the library</h3>

  <p>
  In addition to the terms imposed by the QPL, we ask for the
  following courtesy:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li> Every publication presenting numerical results obtained with
       the help of <acronym>deal.II</acronym> should state the name of
       the library and its principal authors, as well as cite
       the canonical deal.II reference listed at the top of <a
       href="publications/toc.html">the publications page</a>.
  </ul>
  This is the usual, fair way of giving credit to contributors to a
  scientific result. In addition, it helps us justify our effort in
  developing deal.II as an academic undertaking.

  <p>

  We keep a  <a href="publications/toc.html">list of publications
  using deal.II</a>. Feel free to let us know about your publications.


  <a name="3rdparty">
  <h3>Parts of the deal.II distribution under a separate license</h3>
  </a>

  Some of the files in the <code>contrib/</code> subdirectory are by
  other people, and are distributed under separate licenses. These
  files are not part of the <acronym>deal.II</acronym> library, but
  they are part of our distribution. They are generally available for
  use in non-commercial academic settings. For commercial use and if
  you want to distribute your codes, please consult the licenses of
  these parts of the deal.II distribution. We made sure that those parts of the
  distribution for which the license is not entirely free for all uses can be
  disabled upon configuration of <acronym>deal.II</acronym> without
  unduly restricting the functionality of the rest of the
  library.

  <p>

  In particular, these are libraries that we distribute in the
  <code>contrib/</code> subdirectory, courtesy of their authors:
  <ul>
    <li> Parts of the <a href="http://www.boost.org/" target="_top">BOOST</a>
         library.
    <li> <a
         href="http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/umfpack/"
         target="_top">UMFPACK</a>. For the license, see <a
	 href="http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/umfpack/"
	 target="_top">UMFPACK</a>.
    <li> <a href="http://warp.povusers.org/FunctionParser/"
         target="_top">FunctionParser</a>. For the license see <a
	 href="http://warp.povusers.org/FunctionParser/"
	 target="_top">FunctionParser</a>.
  </ul>

  <p>
    
  <acronym>deal.II</acronym> can interface with a number of <a
  href="readme.html#external-libs">other packages</a> that you have to install
  yourself. They are, of course, covered by their own licenses.
  </p>



  <h3>About the license</h3>

  <p>
  The QPL was originally developed by
  <a href="http://www.troll.no" target="_top">Troll Tech</a> for their
  Qt program library, but has since gained some support by other
  library authors as well.
  For more information on the QPL, please follow
  <a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/4.0/qpl.html" target="_top">this link</a>.
