/**
 * Class EquationBase is abstract base class for a general time dependent model. This class should provide general interface
 * that can be used for general coupling of various particular models. By a model we mean a discrete solver of
 * an partial or ordinary differential equation. Result of the model at one discrete time level should be a discrete field class (not yet implemented).
 * Until we have field classes we only provide method @fn get_solution_vector, which returns pointer to sequential C array with linear combination of
 * base functions that represents the solution.
 *
 * This class does not implement any constructor. In particular it does not initialize mesh, mat_base, and time. This has to be done in the constructor
 * of particular child class.
 *
 * TODO: clarify initialization of data members
