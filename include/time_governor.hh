/**
 * @brief
 * Basic time management functionality for unsteady solvers.
 *
 * This includes:
 * - actual time
 * - actual time step
 * - choice of next time step
 * - fixed times that has to be meet
 * - time level
 * - time comparison
 * TODO: should be initialized directly from JSON input
 *
 * Ideas: Distinguish init_time and start_time. The former one is initial value of the time value, the latter one is the beginning of the time frame
 * where an unsteady solver takes a place. Could be useful for short time processes
