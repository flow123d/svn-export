Test problem 11
---------------
verification of:
- chemical kinetics - Trichlorethen dechloration, 2*MnO4- + C2Cl3H -> 3*Cl- + 2*CO2 + 2*MnO2 + H+,
- chemical equilibrium - H2O <-> H+ + OH-,
in combination with transport (column experiment).
- radioactive decay described by decay chain with more branches,
without combination with transport (zero pressure gradient).
