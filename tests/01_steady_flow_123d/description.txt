Test problem 1
---------------------
setting:
- cube cutted by two diagonal 2d fractures which are furter separated by a 1D chanel in their crossection
- boundary conditions: simple pressure gradient in direction form one corner of cube to the oposite corner
  this is applied on all boundary faces of all dimensions

verification of:
- steady darcy flow solved by MH
- flow multidimenzional connection (1D-2D,2D-3D)
- calculation of schur complements
- PETSC cg solver
- parallel sover using PCASM - overlaping domain decomposition
