  -q [queue]  start job noninteractively in 'queue' of the batch system
	      (on Rex omit queue name)
  
  -wt time    set upper esstimate of the time your job need to finish,
              is necessary for the automatic choice of a queue
              default value is 4:00:00 (i.e. 4 hours)
                
  -m          set MPI_NAP to allow run multiple processes on one processor
              (slow workaround some bug in SGI's MPI)

  \$PBS_USR_PARAMS  - by this variable you can specify set of parameters
              you wish to be passed to qsub every time
              (usefull for -m and -M parametr for set mail reporting
               see: man qsub)
