Output type 2 file format, version 1.0

The file is divided in two sections, header and data.

$FlowField
T = time 
n_rows
output_number element_number scalar n_sides sides_scalar sides_flux n_neighs_vv neighs_vv_id
$EndFlowField

Where
time		double	- time in which are following values
n_rows		int	- number of the records. Should be the same as the number of the elements
output_number	int	- id number of the record
element_number	int	- id number of the element
scalar		double	- scalar value in the element (usualy press)
n_sides		int	- number of sides of the element
sides_scalar    double  - scalar values on the sides of the element
sides_flux	double  - flux throught the sides of the element
n_neighs_vv	int 	- number of the VV neighbours
neighs_vv_id	int	- id numbers of the neighbours

Note: There can be more than only one section $FlowField - $EndFlowField. 
In this case they are following one by one...
