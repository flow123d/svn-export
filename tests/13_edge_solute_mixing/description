Test of mixing of substances on edges and qunatitative test on trivial transport problem.

Setting:

Fork consists of :
* incomming branch in XY plane 
  material number 17, conductivity 1, water flux 1
  length 5
and two outcome branch
* one with positive Z coordinate
  material number 18, conductivity 0.1, water flux 0.05 * sqrt(2)
  length 5*sqrt(2)
* second with negative Z coordinate
  material number 19, conductivity 1, water flux 0.5 * sqrt(2)
  length 5*sqrt(2)
